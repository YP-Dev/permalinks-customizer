By using <strong>Permalinks Customizer</strong> you can set the permalinks for each post-type seperately. 

<strong>How to set the Permalinks for the post-types seperately</strong>

Let's assume that you have 6 <strong>post-types</strong> and they all have different style of <strong>permalinks</strong>. Like: 

1. <strong>Blog:</strong> For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/blog/year-month-date-postname/
2. <strong>Customers:</strong> For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/customers/postname/
3. <strong>Events:</strong> For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/events/year-month-date-postname/
4. <strong>Press:</strong> For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/press/category/year/postname/
5. <strong>News:</strong> For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/news/year/postname/
6. <strong>Sponsors:</strong> For this post type you want to create a <strong>permalink</strong> which looks like this: http://www.example.com/company/sponsor/post_title/

This plugin allows you to do this very easily. You just need to go on <strong>Permalinks Customizer</strong> Settings Page. Where text fields are shown with post-type name. You can define your permalinks you want to create for each post type. 

If you leave the some post-type fields empty. So, <strong>Permalinks Customizer</strong> would create a permalink for that post-type by using the default <strong>permalink</strong> settings.

<strong>How to Configure Permalinks Customizer</strong>
> You can configure the plugin by going to the menu `Permalinks Customizer` that appears in your admin menu. <strong>OR</strong> http://www.example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=permalinks-customizer-settings

<strong>Structure Tags</strong>

* <strong>%title%</strong>: Title of the post. let's say the title is "This Is A Great Post!" so, it becomes this-is-a-great-post in the URI.
* <strong>%year%</strong>: The year of the post, four digits, for example 2004
* <strong>%monthnum%</strong>: Month of the year, for example 05
* <strong>%day%</strong>: Day of the month, for example 28
* <strong>%hour%</strong>: Hour of the day, for example 15
* <strong>%minute%</strong>: Minute of the hour, for example 43
* <strong>%second%</strong>: Second of the minute, for example 33
* <strong>%post_id%</strong>: The unique ID # of the post, for example 423
* <strong>%postname%</strong>: A sanitized version of the title of the post (post slug field on Edit Post/Page panel). So "This Is A Great Post!" becomes this-is-a-great-post in the URI.
* <strong>%category%</strong>: A sanitized version of the category name (category slug field on New/Edit Category panel). Nested sub-categories appear as nested directories in the URI.
* <strong>%product_cat%</strong> : A sanitized version of the product category name (category slug field on New/Edit Category panel). Nested sub-categories appear as nested directories in the URI. <i>This <strong>tag</strong> is specially used for WooCommerce Products.</i>
* <strong>%author%</strong>: A sanitized version of the author name.

<strong>Note</strong>: *%postname%* is similar as of the *%title%* tag but the difference is that *%postname%* can only be set once whereas *%title%* can be changed. let's say the title is "This Is A Great Post!" so, it becomes "this-is-a-great-post" in the URI(At the first time, *%postname%* and *%title%* works same) but if you edit and change title let's say "This Is A WordPress Post!" so, *%postname%* in the URI remains same "this-is-a-great-post" whereas *%title%* in the URI becomes "this-is-a-wordpress-post"

<strong>Be warned:</strong> *This plugin is not a replacement for WordPress's built-in permalink system*. Check your WordPress administration's "Permalinks" settings page first, to make sure that this doesn't already meet your needs.
